                            <h3>A Temporal and Geographical analysis of the primary causes of death in the world.</h3>
						</header>
						<p>This Project was written in collaboration with Paolo Caggiano for the Data Visualization course in the Master Degree in Data Science. <br>
                            The objective of our research is to analyse the changes of the principal causes	of death temporally and geographically.
							This investigation will be developed by	addressing further sub-questions.
							We want to have a first look into the geographical distribution of these causes of death in this 30 years span, i.e. 1990-2019.
							Then, we will move on analysing, between them, which have been the most	deadly through time. It is probable that this distribution is different in every
							continent, so we will have a deeper look into every territory.
							Then, for addressing the temporal part of this research, we will move on to	analysing how every cause have changed through the years.
							Lastly, we want to have a close look into natural disasters and see the impact of big natural events on the affected countries. We chose this cause of death among
							the others because it stands out: it is easy to relate them to a specific event and they do not have a similar trend to the others, since they are characterized by
							peaks. <br>
                            <br>
                            To answer this questions, we use a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/cause-of-deaths-around-the-world">dataset from the Kaggle platform</a>.
							The dataset has been cited in a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease">research</a> written by the non-profit organisation “our world in data”.
							In this research the data were originally taken by the <a href="https://www.healthdata.org/gbd/2019">Global Burden of Disease Study</a> carried out by the “Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)”. <br>
                            <br>
                            The project therefore showcases our ability to build an useful and <strong>interactive</strong> dashboard that gives the user the ability to navigate through data in a meaningful way.
							To do this, we used the platform <strong>Tableau</strong>.
							We also carried out meaningful user's tests and questionnaires to understand eventual barriers and improve the interpretability of our dashboard. <br>
                            <br> 
                            Further information about the decisions we made for the plots used, the color palette and the user-tests can be read on the official <strong>report</strong>.</p>
